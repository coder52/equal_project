# Flower Irrigation System with Deep Learning 

This Project is part of the IoT project at the Hochschule Kaiserslautern. The aim of this part of the project is to create a system that can control and decide the irrigation work of houseplants by using artificial intelligence (Deep Learning and Dens Net). The images required for training CNN to run the project and the .csv file required for training Dens Net are not provided here. 

**Follow the instruction below to run the project**

1. You can run the project with Anaconda the easiest. So download Anaconda or miniconda.

2. You can download the requirements with the help of the **environment.yaml** file.

    - open anaconda prompt.
    - go to the directory where the environment.yaml file is.
    - write 'conda env create -f environment.yaml' command. 
    - click 'y' when y/n has been seen
    - write 'conda activate equal' command when installation finish is
    - if you're seeing 'equal' on the head of the directory in the command prompt you are ready for the next step
    
3. Now enter the 'Jupyter Notebook' command at the command prompt

4. Run the 'Laboratory for Plant Thirst Classification with Transfer Learning.ipynb' file on the opened browser.
    * A new browser tab will open. In order for the codes in this tab to work, there must be train and test images in a file called 'flowers'.
